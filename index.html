      <h2>Overview</h2>
      In this project, we go over different techniques for cloth simulation
      using a point mass + spring system. In part1, we construct the cloth using
      point mass and spring, we then calculate the force on each point mass to
      simulate its position at each timestep using verlet integration in part 2.
      In part 3, we implement collision with obstacles to make sure the cloth
      will interact correctly when collide with sphere and plane, so it won't
      just clip through or ignore the obstacles. We then implement self
      collision to make sure that the cloth won't clip through itself but
      instead fold on itself during simulation to make the process more
      realistic in part 4. At last in part 5, we implement some interesting
      shaders using GLSL to make the scene more realistic or interesting. We
      also implement bump mapping and displacement mapping to get some illusion
      of detail (bumps) as well as changes in object geometry.

      <h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
      In this part, we construct the cloth using a point mass + springs system.
      We first create all the point masses and store them into a vector in a row
      major order, we then create all the springs that we need for the system.
      Over here, depends on the position of the point mass, it may or may not
      have all the constraints springs, like for the point masses on the left
      most edge, they shouldn't have a spring that connects to its left since
      that doesn't exist, so we need to consider the edge cases carefully.

      <p>
        Here are the results: (The pictures maybe alisasing on the webpage, zoom
        in will probably fix the problem). Note that even I zoom in to the
        extreme on my side, there are still some aliasing, so I added the zoomed
        in pictures just to make sure.

      <h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
      In this part, we are trying to simulate the motion of the cloth at each
      time step. Which we first compute the force due to external acceleration
      (ex. gravity) on all the point masses, we then compute all the forces due
      to the springs in the system on each point mass using Hook's Law. After we
      have all the forces calculated and sumed up correctly for each pointt
      mass, we then can compute the position of each point mass using Verlet
      Integration. At last, we need to add the constraints to the positions of
      all the point masses so that all the springs can't streched over 10% of
      its rest length.

      <p>
        Here are the final results comparing different properties of the cloth:

      <p>
        As we can see, with higher k_s, the cloth is more stiff, and with lower
        k_s, the cloth is more soft. This make snese since according to Hook's
        Lae, the force between the spring is proportional to the spring
        constant, with higher k_s, the force is bigger, so it will bring the
        particles closer, and with lower k_s, the force is smaller and the cloth
        will be looser.
      </p>

      <p>
        For denisty, the result is quite expected. With higher density, the mass
        of each point mass is higher, which will end up with greater weights, so
        it require more forces from the spring to "pick up" the particles. So as
        we can see in the pictures, with higher density, the cloth has a bigger
        bump on the top, and with lower density, the bump is smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, for damping, which is quite hard to show its effect using only
        pictures. In general, damping is for simulating the loss of energy due
        to friction, heat loss, and other effects. So with higher damping, the
        falling speed of the cloth is really slow as energy is rapidly lost,
        which I was able to take a screenshot during the falling quite easily.
        And for lower damping, the energy loss is almost 0, which the cloth will
        keep swinging back and forth for a while before it comes to an end. And
        the screenshot was taken when it was still swinging.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
      In this part, we are handling the collision between the cloth and other
      obstacles, which is a sphere and a place. For both of the collision, we
      first need to check whether is there any collision or not, and calculate
      the correction vector based on the collision point, and apply the
      collision vector to the point mass's last position with some scaling to
      get a correct final position.

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <p>
        For sphere, we check whether there is collision or not by checking
        whether the point mass is within the radius of the sphere. We then
        calculate the tangent point by getting the unit direction vector from
        the center to the point mass current position, and times the radius to
        get the point on the sphere surface. We can now get the correction
        vector easily by subtract the point mass's lat position from the
        tangent, and the correction vector back to the point mass's last
        position with the sclaing of (1 - f) to get the final position of the
        point mass.

        />
        <figcaption>Sphere with k_s = 50000</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As we discussed above, with higher k_s, the cloth is more stiff, where
        you can see the same effect here. And for lower k_s, the cloth is more
        soft and loose, which is also shown here as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        For plane, we are using the ray-plane collision idea. Which the ray is
        simply the unit vector ir current position minus the last position. If
        the y coordinates of current position is lower than the plane, and the y
        coordinates of the last position is above the plane, we consider that as
        a collision. (Note that this only works or a flat plane where y is
        uniform, but it serves well for our purpose in the project). We then
        calculate the time of collision using the ray-plane collision fomula for
        the tangent point. Over here, we set the y position of the tangent point
        to be slightly above the plane using SURFACE_OFFSET a provided. And the
        rest of the logic is the same as in sphere collision, calculate the
        correction and add it back to last position with the scaling of (1 - f)
        to get the final psotion.

      <h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
      In this part, we are dealing with self collision, which we want to avoid
      the cloth from clipping thorugh itself, but folding on itself instead. At
      first, we need to create a hash table that the key is generated using the
      position of the point mass that map it to a float that represent a 3D box
      volume. using the equation for w, h, and t provided in the spec, we just
      truncated x, y, z coordinates of the point mass using modular and come up
      with some uniqe number at last (we use (z + x * y) * 3, but there are a
      lot more possible way)

      <br />
      <br />

      After we have all the keys, we now need to build the spatial map using the
      keys.We simply just loop over all the point masses, and calculate its key,
      if the key already exits, push back the point mass to the vector, if the
      key does not exist, create a new vector, store it into the map, annd push
      back the point mass.

      <br />
      <br />

      At last, after we have the spatial map, we need to check whether there is
      self collsion or not and adjust the point mass position. For a given point
      mass, we loop over all the other point masses that is in the same class as
      it, we check whether the distance between then is small enough to consider
      as a collision (less than 2 * thickness), and we calculate an overall
      correction vector that will pull the given point mass from colliding with
      all the other point masses in the same class. Note that we need to skip
      "self colliding point mass" since a pointmass will always "collide with
      itself". We then scale the correction vector using simulation_steps. In
      the simulate() function, we simply just create the spatial map, and call
      self_collide() function on every pointmass.

        become flat easily, and with lower density, the cloth will be more
        fluffy after self collision.
